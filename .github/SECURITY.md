# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| < main  | :x:                |

**Note:** As this is an MVP project, we currently only support the latest main branch. We recommend always using the most recent commit for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues by:

1. **Email**: Send details to info@instamega.com with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report - Agent Platform MVP"
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature (if available for your repository)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include proof-of-concept code (but please be responsible)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation or fixes

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
2. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
3. We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
4. We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Rotate API keys regularly**
- **Use separate API keys** for development, staging, and production
- **Monitor API key usage** for unusual activity

### Redis Security

- **Use authentication** (`REDIS_PASSWORD`) even in development
- **Network isolation**: Don't expose Redis to the public internet
- **Regular updates**: Keep Redis Stack updated to the latest version
- **Access controls**: Limit Redis access to necessary applications only

### Slack Integration Security

- **Token security**: Treat Slack tokens as highly sensitive credentials
- **Scope limitation**: Use minimal required scopes for bot tokens
- **Regular rotation**: Rotate Slack tokens periodically
- **Monitor activity**: Review Slack app activity logs regularly

### General Security Practices

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update Python packages
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs, especially in document processing
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data
- **Access controls**: Implement proper access controls for production deployments

### Deployment Security

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections in production
- **Container security**: If using Docker, follow container security best practices
- **Network security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
- **Backup security**: Secure and encrypt backups

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

This is an MVP project with the following security considerations:

1. **No built-in authentication**: The CLI and API endpoints don't include user authentication
2. **Redis access**: Direct Redis access without additional authorization layers
3. **File processing**: Document processing could be vulnerable to malicious files
4. **API rate limiting**: No built-in rate limiting for API calls

### Recommendations for Production Use

Before using this project in production:

1. **Add authentication and authorization**
2. **Implement rate limiting**
3. **Add input sanitization and validation**
4. **Use a reverse proxy with security headers**
5. **Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring**
6. **Conduct a security audit**
7. **Set up dependency scanning**

## Security Tools and Dependencies

### Recommended Security Tools

- **bandit**: For Python security linting
- **safety**: For dependency vulnerability scanning
- **pip-audit**: For Python package vulnerability checking
- **semgrep**: For static analysis security testing

### Dependency Management

- Regularly run `pip-audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
- Review new dependencies for security implications

## Security Updates

We will announce security updates through:

- GitHub releases with security tags
- Repository security advisories
- This SECURITY.md file updates

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Email**: info@instamega.com

- **General Issues**: Use GitHub issues for non-security bugs
- **Feature Requests**: Use GitHub issues or discussions
